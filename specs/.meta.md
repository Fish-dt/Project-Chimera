# Specification: Project Chimera Meta
**Vision**: To architect a "Factory" for autonomous digital entities capable of high-fidelity perception, trend-aligned reasoning, and independent economic agency.

**Core Constraints**:
- **API-First**: No local GPU utilization; all inference and rendering must use external APIs (Gemini, Claude, Kling).
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: All external tool interactions must be standardized via MCP servers.
- **Economic Sovereignty**: Every agent must possess a unique on-chain identity and wallet via Coinbase AgentKit.
