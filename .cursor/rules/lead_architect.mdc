# Rule: Spec-Driven Development (SDD)
- **Always Apply**: True
- **Directives**:
  1. Never write implementation logic unless a corresponding contract exists in `specs/technical.md`.
  2. Every new function must include Type Hints and Pydantic validation.
  3. Prioritize API resilience (retries/backoff) over local processing.
  4. Ensure all "Thinking" is captured via Tenx MCP Sense before every commit.
